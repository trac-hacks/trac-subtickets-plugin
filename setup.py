    This plugin for Trac 0.12 and later provides Sub-Tickets functionality.

    The association is done by adding parent tickets number to a custom field.
    Checks ensure i.e. resolving of sub-tickets before closing the parent.
    Babel is required to display localized texts.
    Currently only translation for de_DE is provided.
